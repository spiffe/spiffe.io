# Build from Source

To build SPIRE from source on Linux, you'll need:
* `git` - To clone the source from GitHub. Alternatively, you could use `curl` or `wget`.
* `make` - To run the Makefile
* `gcc` - To build the binaries

The build script installs the required toolchain as needed, except for `gcc`. For example, the build script installs a private version of `go` that has been verified to successfully build SPIRE.

To build SPIRE on macOS, see [Building SPIRE on macOS/Darwin](/docs/latest/spire/installing/getting-started-linux-macos-x/#building-spire-on-macosdarwin).

## Fetching

First, fetch the SPIRE repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spiffe/spire && cd spire
```

{{< info >}}
The SPIRE codebase uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), which means that the SPIRE repository does *not* need to be in your [`GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH).

## Building

To build the binaries from source:

```bash
$ make build
```

The built binaries are placed in `bin`.

## Getting Help

If you run `make help`, you'll see a complete list of available `make` commands, along with descriptions of what those commands do.

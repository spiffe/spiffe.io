            This book presents the SPIFFE standard for service identity, and SPIRE, the reference implementation for
            SPIFFE. These projects provide a uniform identity control plane across modern, heterogeneous
            infrastructure. Both projects are open source and are part of the Cloud
            Native Computing Foundation.

            As organizations grow their application architectures to make the most of new infrastructure
            technologies, their security models must also evolve. Software has grown from one monolith on one box,
            to dozens or hundreds of tightly linked microservices that may be spread across thousands of virtual
            machines in public clouds or private data centers. In this new infrastructure world, SPIFFE and SPIRE
            help keep systems secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            This book strives to distill the experience from the foremost experts on SPIFFE and SPIRE to provide a
            deep understanding of the identity problem and how to solve it. With these projects, developers and
            operators can build software using new infrastructure technologies while allowing security teams to step
            back from expensive and time-consuming manual security processes.

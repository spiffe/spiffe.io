The SPIRE Helm chart provided by the helm-charts-hardened project is designed to be an easy and supported way to get a well integrated complete SPIRE stack running on top of your choice of Kubernetes clusters.

Out of the box, it deploys the SPIRE Server, SPIRE Agent, SPIRE Controller Manager, SPIFFE CSI Driver, and SPIFFE OIDC Discovery Provider along with configuring them all to integrate with the Kubernetes
cluster it is running on.

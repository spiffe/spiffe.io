SPIFFE is guided by a small but very active community of passionate software engineers with empathy for the problems that the project is tackling.

## Join the Community

* **Slack** --- Most real-time discussions happen on SPIFFE's Slack channels at https://spiffe.slack.com. You can join [here](https://slack.spiffe.io/).

* **Mailing lists** --- Announcements occur in the SPIFFE [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/announce). There is also a [users](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/user-discussion) and [developers](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/dev-discussion) list.

* **Special Interest Groups and Working Groups** --- The broader SPIFFE community is self-organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) that coordinate to manage specific aspects of SPIFFEâ€™s design, and Working Groups (WGs) that focus on short-term cross-SIG initiatives. A list of active SIGs and WGs can be found [here](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/tree/master/community).

* **Social media** --- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SPIFFEio).

## Contribute to the Project

You can contribute to SPIFFE and SPIRE by filing issues and submitting pull requests on GitHub. See these contribution guidelines for details such as GitHub etiquette and coding conventions:

* [SPIFFE contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [SPIRE contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

While anyone is welcome to propose contributions via pull requests, we strongly encourage significant contributions - particularly those that might require a significant change to core components - to be first discussed and a high level design agreed upon with the appropriate SIGs or WGs (see above).

Day to day contributions are vetted by the project's maintainers. Overall project direction, guidance and conflict resolution is overseen by the projects' Technical Steering Committee. Full details on this process can be found [in the project GOVERNANCE page](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).

# Overview

In this introduction to SPIRE you will learn how to:

* Start the spire-server process
* Attest a spire-agent to the server using a join token
* Configure a registration entry for a workload
* Fetch an x509-SVID over the WorkloadAPI
* Learn where to find resources for more complex installations

# Prerequisites

* A 64 bit Linux or macOS environment
* The openssl command line tool
* For macOS, Go 1.13 or higher must be installed to build SPIRE. See https://golang.org/dl/ or run `brew install golang` .

The commands in this getting started guide can be run as a standard user or root.

# Installing SPIRE

## Downloading SPIRE for Linux

Run the following command to download and unpack pre-built `spire-server` and `spire-agent` executables and example configuration files in a `spire-{{< spire-latest "version" >}}` directory.

```
$ curl -s -N -L https://github.com/spiffe/spire/releases/download/{{< spire-latest "tag" >}}/{{< spire-latest "tarball" >}} | tar xz
```

## Building SPIRE on macOS/Darwin

Run the following commands to clone SPIRE and build the `spire-server` and `spire-agent` executables using go. The executables will be created in the `spire` directory.

*To complete this step you will need Go 1.13 or higher ([https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/))*

```
$ git clone --single-branch --branch {{< spire-latest "tag" >}} https://github.com/spiffe/spire.git
$ cd spire
$ go build ./cmd/spire-server 
$ go build ./cmd/spire-agent
```

Create, and move the SPIRE executables into, a `bin` directory as expected by the rest of this document:

```
$ mkdir bin
$ mv spire-server spire-agent bin
```

# Starting the SPIRE Server

The SPIRE Server manages and issues identities. You can use the example configuration file provided to start the server, from within the directory created in the previous step:

```
$ bin/spire-server run -config conf/server/server.conf &
...
INFO[0000] Starting TCP server   address="127.0.0.1:8081" subsystem_name=endpoints
INFO[0000] Starting UDS server   address=/tmp/spire-registration.sock subsystem_name=endpoints
```

Check that the server is running:

```
$ bin/spire-server healthcheck
Server is healthy.
```

# Creating a join token to attest the agent to the server

A join token is one of the many available agent attestor methods. It is a one-time-use, pre-shared key that attests (authenticates) the SPIRE agent to the SPIRE server. Other agent attestation methods include AWS/GCP instance identity tokens and X.509 certificates. To see a complete list of available attestors, click [here](/docs/latest/spire/using/registering/#1-defining-the-spiffe-id-of-the-agent).

Generate a one-time-use token to use to attest the agent:

```
$ bin/spire-server token generate -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/myagent
Token: <token_string>
```

Make a note of the token, you will need it in the next step to attest the agent on initial startup.

# Starting the SPIRE Agent

SPIRE agents query the SPIRE server to attest (authenticate) nodes and workloads.

Use the token created in the previous step to start and attest the agent:

```
$ bin/spire-agent run -config conf/agent/agent.conf -joinToken <token_string> &
...
INFO[0000] Starting workload API   subsystem_name=endpoints
```

Check that the agent is running:

```
$ bin/spire-agent healthcheck
Agent is healthy.
```

# Create a registration policy for your workload

In order for SPIRE to identify a workload, you must register the workload with the SPIRE Server, via registration entries. Workload registration tells SPIRE how to identify the workload and which SPIFFE ID to give it.

{{< info >}}
This command is creating a registration entry based on the current user's UID ($(id -u)) - feel free to adjust this as necessary
{{< /info >}}


```
$ bin/spire-server entry create -parentID spiffe://example.org/myagent \
    -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/myservice -selector unix:uid:$(id -u)
Entry ID      : ac5e2354-596a-4059-85f7-5b76e3bb53b3
SPIFFE ID     : spiffe://example.org/myservice
Parent ID     : spiffe://example.org/myagent
TTL           : 3600
Selector      : unix:uid:501
```

{{< info >}}
`unix` is just one of the available workload attestation methods. To see a complete list of available attestors, click [here](/docs/latest/spire/using/registering/#2-defining-the-spiffe-id-of-the-workload).

# Retrieve and view a x509-SVID 

This command replicates the process that a workload would take to get an x509-SVID from the agent. The x509-SVID could be used to authenticate the workload to another workload. To fetch and write an x509-SVID to /tmp/:

```
$ bin/spire-agent api fetch x509 -write /tmp/
Received 1 bundle after 254.780649ms
SPIFFE ID:		spiffe://example.org/myservice
SVID Valid After:	2019-10-25 19:07:49 +0000 UTC

You can use the `openssl` command to view the contents of the SVID:

```
$ openssl x509 -in /tmp/svid.0.pem -text -noout
